    "RuleHint": "To find the bold texts, search for double stars, i.e., **, the content between two occurrences of double stars is the bold texts. Note that the bold range should start from the double stars occurring at i-th spot throughout the whole input file, where i is odd, and end with double stars occurring at jth spot where j is even. For example, text between double stars appearing first and second time."
