    "RuleHint": "To find the content of certain section, starting from the headings start with one hashtag, and go to the ith heading as specified in number of sections. Then start from that line, look for j-th heading with 2 hashtags as specified in subsection number. For kth subsubsection, look for kth heading with 3 hashtags starting from the located subsubsection. Stop searching early if the subsection or subsubsection is not queried."
