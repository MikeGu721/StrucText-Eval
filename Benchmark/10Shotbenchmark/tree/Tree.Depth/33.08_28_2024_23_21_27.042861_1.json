    "RuleHint": "To find the depth of a node, you need to find the number of edges from root to node. You have to start from the root with depth 0 and assign the depth for each node recursively. For any given node, it gets depth of current depth. Increment the depth by 1 before go to its subtree and repeat the process until every node gets a depth."
