    "RuleHint": "To find the bold texts, search for single star, i.e., *, the content between two occurrences of single star is the bold texts. Note that the bold range should start from the single star occurring at i-th spot throughout the whole input file, where i is odd, and end with single star occurring at jth spot where j is even. For example, text between single star appearing first and second time."
