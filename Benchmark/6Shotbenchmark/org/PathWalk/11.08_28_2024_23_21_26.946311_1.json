    "RuleHint": "Note that section, subsection, subsubsection titles are preceded by *, **, *** respectively, with one or more whitespaces in between.  To find the content of certain section, look for ith section as specified, and start from there look for jth subsection. And from located subsection, look for kth subsubsection as queried. Search may stop early if subsection or subsubsection is not queried."
